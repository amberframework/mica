  # Rabin-Karp search with a fixed base, so crafted inputs can make it
  # quadratic).

  # The search is Knuth-Morris-Pratt over bytes: at most
  # `2 * haystack.size + 2 * needle.size` comparisons, plus `needle.size`
  # steps for allocating the failure table, all reported to the step block
  # before they happen. UTF-8 is
  # self-synchronizing, so a byte match of a valid UTF-8 needle in valid
  # UTF-8 text always starts on a character boundary.
