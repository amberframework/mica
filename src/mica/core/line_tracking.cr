  # Line and column tracking for text formats, included next to `ByteInput`.
  #
  # The scanner calls `record_line_break` after each line end it consumes
  # (each format decides what a line end is). Columns are not counted while
  # scanning: `column_at` counts the characters (UTF-8 lead bytes) between
  # the line start and a position when one is asked for. A cache of the last
  # answer makes repeated questions on the same line cost only the distance
  # moved, so asking for the position after every event stays linear in the
  # input size even on a single-line document.
  #
  # Line and column numbers saturate at `Int32::MAX` (the byte offset in a
  # `Position` stays exact), so a stream of any length cannot overflow
  # them.
